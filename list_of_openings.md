## [English Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/english-opening/)
The English opening is the 4th most common opening for white. Although the English has its own style, the opening is very flexible and many times transposes into other opening lines. The objective of the opening is to apply pressure on the center d5 square without committing the queen pawn or the king pawn. Since the move is a flank move many players like the English because of its hypermodern style of play (using pieces from the sides along with minor pieces to apply pressure and control the center).

White’s 2nd move depends on black’s response. If black does not immediately try to control the center white can fianchetto his bishop with 2. g3 3. Bg2 and white starts to apply even more pressure on the d5 square and gives white the control over the light squares. Many English games will start out very slow as both sides build up pressure around the center.

## [Grob Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/grob-attack/)
The Grob Attack is not a common opening and many people think of it as one of white’s weakest opening choices because it doesn’t attack the center of the board and it weakens the king’s safety. It begins with the move:

1. g4

[(...) for more info click here!](grob-attack/)

## [Grunfeld Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/grunfeld-defense/)
The Grunfeld Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns.

## [Larsens Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/larsens-opening/)
Larsens Opening is a change of pace from the typical openings where white looks to control the center of the board with this d and e pawns.  Instead white will play his bishop to b2 and control the dark square diagonal which will put pressure on black’s king side.

This is not an aggressive opening but does give white many favorable positions and also is poorly prepared for by black.

## [Nimzo Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/nimzo-indian-defense/)

## [Petrov Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/petrov-defense/)
The Petrov Defense, sometimes referred to as the Russian game is one of the more popular games with GMs because of its generally drawish tendencies. Many other players prefer to play the Petrov Defense so that they can avoid the lines of the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game. For those players that like to play e5 but don’t like the normal defenses, then this might be a good alternative.

Black has to be careful with how he continues in the Petrov. If white captures on e5 then black can’t continue to mirror and take on e4 or he will end up being down in material. Instead black should first play d6, forcing the white knight back and then take on e4. If both sides want to open things up, then they can exchange knights on c3 which will usually result in a queenside castle for white and very aggressive play from both sides.

## [Philidor Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/philidor-defense/)
The Philidor Defense is an alternative move to the more common 2…Nc6 move from black. While very solid, it is extremely passive and thought to be a weaker option to Nc6. Because of this, it is rare to see at high level play.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6

## [Pirc Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/pirc-defense/)

## [Queens Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/queens-indian-defense/)

## [Reti Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/reti-gambit/)
The Reti Gambit is an aggressive approach to attack the French Defense and it starts with the moves:

1. e4 e6
2. b3

[(...) for more info click here!](reti-gambit/)

## [Reti Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/reti-opening/)
The Reti Opening has at times been referred to as the Opening of the Future. It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.

Most players are more comfortable moving a pawn on their first move as white to control the center but the Reti opening uses a flank technique to attack the center with its minor piece and allows for quick castling on the kingside.

## [Ruy Lopez](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/ruy-lopez/)
The Ruy Lopez is the cornerstone of classical play in chess. There are probably more variations for the Ruy Lopez than any other opening. With the common use of the double king’s pawn opening (1.e4 e5), the Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It’s almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5

## [Scotch Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/scotch-gambit/)
There are a few ways to offer a gambit as white in the Scotch Game.  The most common, and one that we will focus on this page, is white playing Bc4 instead of taking with his knight on d4.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4
4. Bc4

[(...) for more info click here!](scotch-gambit/)

## [Scotch Game](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/scotch-game/)
The Scotch Game has recently regained popularity as many top level players have used it as a surprise against players who are well equipped to face the Ruy Lopez. The Scotch is very similar to the Center Game where d4 opens up lines for development and also gives white early center control. In the Scotch Game, black will be able to develop easy and white should look to take advantage of its special and center control.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4

## [Semi-Slav](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/semi-slav/)
The Semi-Slav Defense is one of the most popular defenses for black against the Queen’s Gambit line from white. This opening is seen at all levels of chess competition and is often seen as one of the most sound defenses at top level play.

1.d4 d5
2.c4 c6
3.Nf3 Nf6
4.Nc3 e6

[(...) for more info click here!](semi-slav/)

## [Sicilian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/sicilian-defense/)
The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.

Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.

## [Slav Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/slav-defense/)
The Slav Defense is one of the most popular openings with GM’s. This is for two reasons. The first is that it is one of the most solid lines to play against the Queens Gambit and with the Queens Gambit being a regular opening at high level play, many top players have become fans of this opening.

1. d4 d5
2. c4 c6

## [The Alien Gambit Trap](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/the-alien-gambit-trap/)
The dance begins with the classic 1.e4. In response, Black sets the stage for the Caro-Kann, steering the pawn to c6. The plan? To challenge White’s central dominance with …d5. White, however, is undeterred and solidifies their grasp on the center with d4.

## [The Three Knights Game](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/the-three-knights-game/)


Let’s unpack this chess opening and discover why it might be your next strategic move on the board. We start with the classic opening moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6, setting a familiar chessboard stage. Things take a twist when White plays 3. Nc3. At this junction, should Black respond with 3...Nf6, we’re ushered into the Four Knights Game. However, our focus is on the alternatives Black has at their disposal, sidestepping 3...Nf6.
