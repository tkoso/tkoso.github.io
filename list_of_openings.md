## [Calabrese Countergambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/calabrese-countergambit/)
The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and dominate the center of the board.

## [Grob Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/grob-attack/)

## [Grunfeld Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/grunfeld-defense/)
The Grunfeld Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.

1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 g6
3. Nc3 d5

## [Halloween Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/halloween-gambit/)
The Halloween Gambit, or the Muller-Schulze Gambit derives from the Four Knights Game but then takes on a very aggressive approach as white sacrifices a knight for a pawn with the hopes of controlling the center with white’s pawns.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6

## [Icelandic Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/icelandic-gambit/)

1. e4 d5
2. exd5 Nf6
3. c4 e6

## [Larsens Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/larsens-opening/)
Larsens Opening is a change of pace from the typical openings where white looks to control the center of the board with this d and e pawns.  Instead white will play his bishop to b2 and control the dark square diagonal which will put pressure on black’s king side.

This is not an aggressive opening but does give white many favorable positions and also is poorly prepared for by black.

## [Lolli Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/lolli-attack/)
The Lolli Attack is an aggressive opening for white in the Italian game when black defends with the two knights defense. Instead of immediately sacrificing the knight on f7, white instead plays d4, sacrificing another pawn and then castling kingside.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6
4. Ng5 d5
5. exd5 Nxd5
6. d4 exd4

[(...) for more info click here!](lolli-attack/)

## [London System](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/london-system/)
The London System is a great chess opening for beginning chess players. It quickly develops the dark square bishop which is a very underutilized minor piece for white.

The opening doesn’t start out aggressive, and many times ends in a closed game, but it gives white lots of options and is very useful is stopping black from any counterattack.

[(...) for more info click here!](reti-gambit/)

## [Reti Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/reti-opening/)
The Reti Opening has at times been referred to as the Opening of the Future. It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.

Most players are more comfortable moving a pawn on their first move as white to control the center but the Reti opening uses a flank technique to attack the center with its minor piece and allows for quick castling on the kingside.

## [Ruy Lopez](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/ruy-lopez/)
The Ruy Lopez is the cornerstone of classical play in chess. There are probably more variations for the Ruy Lopez than any other opening. With the common use of the double king’s pawn opening (1.e4 e5), the Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It’s almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5

The Scandinavian Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings in chess. From the very first move, black looks to undermine the center control of white after the common e4 move by white.

## [Sicilian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/sicilian-defense/)
The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.

Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.
