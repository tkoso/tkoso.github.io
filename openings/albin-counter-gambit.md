# Albin Counter-Gambit

[back to list](..)



The Albin Counter-Gambit is a hyper aggressive defense for black against the ever so popular queens gambit from white.

1. d4 d5
2. c4 e5

Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.

This opening will immediately take a queens gambit player out of his element and gives black many fighting chances. If you are a very aggressive player, especially with black, then you definitely need to learn this opening. For all those queenâ€™s gambit players, this is also good to know as your opponent may throw this at you at any time.
